# Django E-commerce Website

This is a Django e-commerce website that allows users to browse products and courses, add items to their cart, and checkout.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/django-e-commerce-website.git
cd django-e-commerce-website
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, create a new Django project and add the `cart` app to your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting.

```
django-admin startproject myproject
cd myproject
python manage.py startapp cart
```

Add the following lines to your `myproject/settings.py` file:

```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    'cart',
]
```

Now, you need to create a database and apply the migrations.

```
python manage.py migrate
```

Finally, you can start the development server.

```
python manage.py runserver
```

## Usage

To use the website, first create a user account. Then, you can browse the products and courses and add items to your cart. When you're ready to checkout, click the "Checkout" button. You'll be prompted to enter your payment information and shipping address. Once you've submitted your order, you'll receive a confirmation email.
